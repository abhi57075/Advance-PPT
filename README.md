# Advance-PPT
Advance PPT using computer vision
This project involves using computer vision and Python to create an application that enables users to perform various PowerPoint functions using hand-signs, such as writing on the slides, pointing at specific areas, navigating to the next or previous page, undoing the previous action, and exiting the presentation. The application utilizes the camera on the user's laptop to detect and interpret the hand-signs for seamless execution of the desired functions.
